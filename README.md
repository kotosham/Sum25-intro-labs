## Lab-Based Learning Experience

**80% of your grade comes from hands-on labs** - each designed to build real-world skills:

1. **Lab Structure**
   - Task-oriented challenges with clear objectives
   - Safe environments using containers/local VMs

2. **Submission Workflow**
   - Fork course repository → Create lab branch → Complete tasks
   - Push to fork → Create Pull Request → Receive evaluation

3. **Grading Advantage**  
   - **Perfect Lab Submissions (10/10)**: Exam exemption + bonus points
   - **Timely Submissions (≥6/10)**: Qualify for C or higher
   - **Late Submissions**: Maximum 6/10

## Evaluation Framework
