# Introduction to DevOps with Git

## Overview

This lab assignment introduces you to Git and its essential operations. You will complete two tasks focusing on commit signing and understanding merge strategies. Follow the tasks below to complete the lab assignment.

## Task 1: SSH Commit Signature Verification

**Objective**: Understand the importance of commit signing using SSH keys and set up commit signature verification.

1. **Explore the Importance of Signed Commits**:
   - **Research**: Learn why commit signing is crucial for verifying the integrity and authenticity of commits.
     - Resources:
       - [GitHub Docs on SSH Commit Verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
       - [Atlassian's Guide to SSH and Git](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/sign-commits-and-tags-with-ssh-keys-1305971205.html)
   - **Summary**: Create a submission1.md file. Write a brief summary explaining the benefits of signing commits.

2. **Set Up SSH Commit Signing**:
   - **Option 1: Use an Existing SSH Key**:
     - Ensure you have an existing SSH key pair.
     - Add the public key to your GitHub account.
       - [GitHub Guide to Adding SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

   - **Option 2: Generate a New SSH Key (Recommended: ed25519 Format)**:
     - Generate a new SSH key pair using the ed25519 format.

       ```sh
       ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
       ```

     - Add the public key to your GitHub account.
       - [GitHub Guide to Adding SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

   - Configure Git to use your new SSH key for signing commits.

     ```sh
     git config --global user.signingkey <YOUR_SSH_KEY>
     git config --global commit.gpgSign true
     git config --global gpg.format ssh
     ```

3. **Make a Signed Commit**:
   - Create and sign a commit.

     ```sh
     git commit -S -m "Your signed commit message"
     ```

   - Push the commit with your submission1.md file.

## Task 2: Merge Strategies in Git

**Objective**: Research the differences between merge strategies in Git and modify repository settings to allow only the standard merge strategy.

1. **Research Merge Strategies**:
   - **Standard Merge**: Combines two branches by creating a merge commit.
   - **Squash and Merge**: Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single commit before merging.
   - **Rebase and Merge**: Reapplies commits from a feature branch onto the base branch.
   - **Summary**: Write a brief summary comparing these merge strategies in the submission1.md file, including their pros and cons. Highlight why the standard merge strategy is often preferred in collaborative environments.

     Resources:
     - [GitHub Docs on Merging](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merge-squash-and-rebase)
     - [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-strategy)

2. **Modify Repository Settings**:
   - **Disable Squash and Rebase Merge**:
     - Go to the Settings page of your forked repository on GitHub.
     - Navigate to the "Options" section.
